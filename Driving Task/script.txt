1. INTRO

    Hi, welcome to the experiment.
    We are conducting a project for a university course.
    We are studying the impact of different Infotainment Systems on attention while driving.

    For this experiments you will not be asked to drive but we will need you to sit in a stationary car and perform some tasks.
    
    Since we are studying attention we use some eye tracking software in order to estimate what you are looking at during the experiment,
    to do this we need to record video of the tasks thorugh a webcam.
    These videos will not be shared with anyone, and will be analyzed automatically by an algorithm.
    Is this ok with you?

    NOTE: ??*sign informed consent*??

    The experiment will consists in a series of tasks, in which we are going to ask you to play a game on the pc
    using a joystick, at the same time we are also going to ask you to perform some tasks on the screen of the car.

    Any questions?

1.5 INTRO QUESTIONNAIRE

    Before we start we need you to fill this questionnarie.

2. FAMILIARIZATION

    Ok, so, the game you will be playing is very simple.
    On the screen there is a ball and a triangle,
    the ball moves randomly from side to side,
    you control the triangle, 
    and you can move it from side to side with the joystick.
    your goal is to follow tha ball as close as possible for the whole time.

    Do you have any questions?

    Ok let's start with some practice runs, to get you familiar with the game.
    Hold the controller with your left hand. (!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!)
    The game lasts for 30 seconds. Follow the ball, do the best you can.

    Ok, let's do it again
