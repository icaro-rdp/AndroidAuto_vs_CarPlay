Goals of the study

Hypothesis
1. Using IVIS systems will have a detremental effect on visual attention on the driving task.
2. Different IVIS sytems will have a different impacts on visual attention, either overall or in analogous tasks.
(which one and why?)
3. Better perceived usability will correlate with a lower impact on visual attention.
4. Familiarity with platform will have an impact with performance and usability



We have two measusres of visual attention
1. driving task performance
2. proportion of time looking at driving task

We have three measures of usability
1. time-on-task
2. post-task questionnaire (SEQ)
3. platfrom questionnaire (UMUX)

We also measure other variables that could affect performance such as:
- Familiarity with systems/platforms
